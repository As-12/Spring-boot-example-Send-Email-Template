# Spring Boot Examples

## Sending Email with Java using HTML template

An example Spring-boot project using Java Mail, Apache Velocity, and HTML template to generate a beautiful templated email. The project serves as a quick boilerplate to be used in other larger projects. Any contribution is welcome by opening a pull request.
The example configures the mailer to send email over Gmail's SMTP protocol. Users will need to authorize "less secure app" on the security setting of their google account.
